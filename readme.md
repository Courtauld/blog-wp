# blog-wp

A WordPress theme developed by Jacob Charles Wilson (@jclwilson) for use on the blogs of The Courtauld Institute of Art and The Courtauld Gallery.

This theme approximates the bespoke theme developed by Eva Bensasson and AD (formerly Alienation Dev) for courtauld.ac.uk.

## contributing

This project uses a [feature-branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).

To add or edit a feature, create a new branch and work on that branch, when finished, submit a pull request, and the feature will be merged into the master branch.

This ensures that the master branch is always a fully working theme.
